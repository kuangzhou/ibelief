* Add the function LCRule for creating bbas from probabilities using Least-Commit Principle.
  
* Change the form of the input/output mass matrix for function discounting. Now for both the input and output mass matrices, each column is a bba. If there is only one bba to discount, the input and output bbas are both vectors. 
   
* Fix the bug that qtow function could not work for dogmatic belief functions. 

* Fix the bug that some FMT functions could not produce an output.
