--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Add the function LCRule for creating bbas from probabilities using Least-Committed Principle.
  
* Change the form of the input/output mass matrix for function discounting. Now for both the input and output mass matrices, each column is a bba. If there is only one bba to discount, the input and output bbas are both vectors. 
   
* Fix the bug that qtow function could not work for dogmatic belief functions. 

* Fix the bug that some FMT functions could not produce an output. 


ibelief 1.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Change the form of the output vector for the combined mass in DST function. Now the output for all the type of bba generated is a column vector.    

* Fix the bug of RandomMass function brought by the base::sample function. 

* Add three types of mass in RandomMass function, consonant bbas and non-dogmatic consonant bbas (both with nested focal elements), SSFs.

* Modify the function DST to be more optimized.

* In DST function, the combination rules LNS and LNSa are added.

* Change the name of the function LCRule to LCPrinciple
